## Visibility-Uncertainty-guided 3D Gaussian Inpainting via Scene Conceptional Learning

### Introduction

We propose VISTA, a novel 3D inpainting method. By combining visual from 3DGS and semantic cues from personalized diffusion models, our approach can remove both static and moving objects in any scene.

### Visualization of our results

We demonstrate some results of our methods from our underwater 3D Inpainting Dataset. The visualization of the source images (left) and the sythetic views (right) is as follows:
